                    <p>Devastated. Heartbroken. Inconsolable. These are all words that described the citizens of Peg City when they found out that their beloved original 202HL franchise, the Spappers, had changed ownership and were leaving the city behind for a bigger market. Despite this, the people of Peg City did not lose their love of the sport of hockey, as the primary industry in the city is the manufacturing of hockey nets and the pegs that keep the goal in place. The city hired all-time great general manager Ben Artuso, who chose to exclusively pursue free agents named Peter, in honor of St. Peter, the patron saint of net makers. By far the most significant signing was free agent Pete Kodakpete, who was looking for a fresh start in a new, accepting community.

                    Making their debut in season 8 of the 202HL, the Petes instantly took the league by storm. They became only the second team in league history to finish with a 9 and 1 record, easily earning the Lemon Trophy for best regular season performance. This success was driven by Withakodakpete, who put up offensive numbers that were remarkable even by his own lofty standards, winning league MVP. In the playoffs, the Shame Knights pled no contest, the defending champions won just one game, and the Coasters were swept in three games, giving the Petes a championship in their inaugural season. Kodakpete won finals MVP, then shocked the world by retiring in the offseason. The team looked radically different in season 9 without their captain, but still managed to win 6 games before being swept in the first round of the playoffs.
