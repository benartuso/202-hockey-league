                    For decades, Chilliwack, British Columbia was a city ruled by one sport: competitive checkers. Locals would cheer on hometown heroes such as Klim Kostin, Aube-Kubel, and St. Denis, who were notorious in the checkers world for their physical and violent style of play, which often drew ire from the officials but praise from the fans. Although the local arena, The Big Checker, was packed to the brim during checkers tournaments, it sat empty most of the year, and owner Nicholas Seyler saw an opportunity. He approached the local checkers athletes and propositioned them with an offer to create a hockey team to represent Chilliwack in the burgeoning 202HL. Many accepted, and began an intensive training process in preparation for joining the league’s fourth season.

                    Expectations were low for their first season as members of the Yet Unnamed Conference, but Chilliwack’s physicality transferred well to hockey. The players were quite pleased to finish their first regular season comfortably in the middle of the pack and qualify for a playoff spot. To the surprise of the league, the Checkers steamrolled the blue-blood Cheese in 5 games, and followed that up with an even more impressive sweep of the Russians to send them to the finals. In an all-time classic series, the Checkers outlasted division rivals the Scouting for Goals in seven games to claim the 202HL championship in their inaugural season, with Kostin being named finals MVP.

                    After this remarkable first season, the Checkers experienced a sophomore slump and drifted to the bottom of the standings, despite winning the highly anticipated coaching rivalry. Fans became disillusioned and stopped showing up to games, with many claiming that biased referees were making it impossible for the team to win. The next two seasons showed a return to form with decent records, but enthusiasm for the team remained low, forcing General Manager Seyler to disband the team prior to season 7.
