                <p>February 22nd, 1980: On this day, the United States’ men's Olympic hockey team defeated the powerhouse defending champions, the Soviet Union, in one of the defining moments of not just sports history, but global political history. This was a crushing defeat for the Soviets, greatly angering leader Leonid Brezhnev and the communist party, who ordered the creation of a top secret ice hockey training and development facility in remote Siberia for the nation’s top athletes. This team, the Soviet Union Soviet Unionians, was kept top secret for years, and in fact was so isolated that members of the facility did not become aware of the fall of the Soviet Union until they were visited by President Vladimir Putin in 2020. After touring the facility and watching the players on ice, he decided that this could be a wonderful opportunity  to prove Russian superiority to the rest of the world, and signed them up for the newly created 202HL.

                The intensive training program created players who lived and breathed hockey, and their desire to win was unquestionable. Perhaps no player was more feared than captain and freak-of-nature Mikhaila Pobletov, but she was surrounded by an all-star cast that included several NHL players who defected out of desire to play for their homeland. Despite this, the team initially had trouble adjusting to the North American Style of play, and finished with a losing record in the inaugural season of the 202HL. However, their record improved the next year, led by Pobletov’s MVP season. Not satisfied with middling results in the playoffs, the Russians continued to improve their regular season win percentages twice more, winning the Lemon trophy in back-to-back seasons. Finally in season four they broke through, going a perfect 12-0 in the playoffs to bring the cup back to Russia, with Kucherov capturing FMVP.

                The next season, they came up just one win short of a championship when they lost to the Coasters in 7 games, but rebounded from that loss by going a perfect 9-0 in the next playoffs to capture their second championship in 3 years. To date, the Russians are the only team with multiple championships. Ovechkin captured the FMVP, then announced his retirement. Pobletov also retired after winning her unprecedented 3rd MVP. With a great loss of talent, the dynasty was over. Since then, the Russians have regressed to being an average team, though fans of the league have learned to never count them out.
